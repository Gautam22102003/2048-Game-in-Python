Code Explanation:

1. The code starts by importing the logic module.
2. This module contains all the functions that we will use in our program.
3. Next, we have a function to initialize the matrix.
4. This is done by calling the start_game() function.
5. The while loop runs until the user presses any of the keyboard keys (W, S, A, D).
6. For each key press, we call one of the functions in logic.
7. These are move_up(), move_down(), and move_left().
8. We also need to call get_current_state() to get information about the current state of our matrix.
9. Each function in logic takes two arguments: mat and flag.
10. mat is the matrix object and flag is either ‘W’ for moving up or ‘S’ for moving down.
11. If you recall from earlier in this chapter, these are references to variables that store data about our game board.
12. After calling each function, we print out its results and then check to see if game is over yet using status variable.
13. If it isn’t over yet, we add a new row to our matrix using add_new_2().
14. Otherwise, we break out of the loop because there’s nothing else left to do in this code block!
15. Finally, at the code starts by importing the logic.py file.
16. This file contains all the functions used in this project.
17. Next, we have written the driver code.
18. In this code, we are checking for the input of a key and depending on that input, we are calling one of the function in logic.py file.
19. We will be discussing each of these functions in detail later on in this article.
20. The while loop is used to keep track of user input and execute the corresponding code inside it.
21. The code inside this loop will be executed until user presses any other key or the game is over.
22. Inside the if statement, we are checking for different keys and depending on that input, we are calling one of the functions from logic.py
